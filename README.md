# ðŸ“šðŸ“– The Tales of Old ðŸ“œðŸ“”
Minecraft Fabric Mod that generates books in generated chests. Filled with many stories. My first non-messaround mod.
#### "Fills your world with stories and history to make it feel 'lived in'. Let's fill up those beautiful new chiseled bookshelves! Find many books and see overarching stories emerge. Send in the story of your Minecraft world to eternalize and share it in this mod!"

<ol>
<li>The loot_tables/stories folder contains all the stories, each in one loot table that drops them 100% of them time without conditions.</li>
<li>The loot tables in loot_tables/chests then link to those story loot tables and define spawn chances.</li>
<li>ModLootTableModifiers file adds the designated loottable from the loot_tables/chests folder to the game.</li>
</ol>
